Software engineer skilled in development, integration, configuration and release management on UNIX/Linux, and Windows systems with extensive telecoms background.

More than 20 years of commercial experience working in agile teams. Added knowledge into web technologies. Looking for a Full-Stack development role.

## About

Since I graduated University in the Computer Science and Control Engineering field, I have enjoyed covering a wide range of software engineering roles. 

I have worked as a software developer ranging a mix of applications and real-time embedded systems areas, from manufacturing production flow, to telecomms protocol stacks implementation, and electrical measurements devices. I also worked as a software integration and delivery engineer in 2G/3G/4G mobile phones for the modem side.

I come to enjoy high quality, easy to read, and maintainable software. Recently, at Makers Academy I received comments about my code being "terse and well structured".

Software engineering is a very dynamic world, and I am always keen on improving myself. Web developement is a very exciting area and has been interested me for a while. In the last year, I took the oportunity to deep dive into learning how to develop web applications that concluded by me joining the now renown Makers Academy.
